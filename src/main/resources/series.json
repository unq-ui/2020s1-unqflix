It is a remake of a famous Argentine series Rebelde Way adapted for the Mexican audience therefore leading to differences in characters' backgrounds. The series ran for three seasons, the final episode airing in Mexico on June 2, 2006. Rebelde was replaced in June 2006 with Televisa's new series Código Postal.\n\nThe series is set at the Elite Way School, a prestigious private boarding high school in Mexico City with a major plot line revolving around a group of students forming a pop band. Additional subplots involve the school's faculty and the students' parents. One trademark of the show is the random use of English words and phrases, often used by fresa characters.\n\nA notable aspect of the series is that the actors playing the bandmembers are themselves in an actual band named RBD, and perform most of the music used on the show. They have been extremely successful in their own right, becoming one of the most popular acts in Latin America and touring internationally.\n\nRebelde began airing March 21, 2005 and ended on December 15, 2006. The show was also transmitted in 65 other countries, including Serbia, Peru, Romania on Acasa TV, Brazil, Spain on Antena 3, Slovenia, Bulgaria and from September 2009 in Slovakia on TV Doma, in Croatia on Nova TV and in Albania on Vizion Plus.",

There are 37 episodes.\n\nContinuing with Marius Constant's theme music, a different set of graphics was used for the opening, consisting of a rotating cone with concentric circles suggesting a spiral, receding into a star field. Rod Serling's narration from the second season was used, with the verse \"That's the signpost up ahead\" taken out:\n\n\"You're traveling through another dimension. A dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination. Your next stop—The Twilight Zone.\" Some subtle changes in the opening's acoustics were made beginning with Person or Persons Unknown.",

Beyond it is another dimension. A dimension of sound. A dimension of sight. A dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into the Twilight Zone.\"",

Ethiopia's Semien Mountains are increasingly encroached upon for farming land, and this example leads to the question of overpopulation. Some interviewees argue that it is not just about numbers: how humans consume their natural resources is also important.",

Although it was successful in saving elephants, the policy was detrimental to the Maasai people, who were forced from their land.

It introduced a number of characters who played significant roles in later episodes, such as Jerry's Uncle Leo and Jerry's neighbor Newman.\n\nFilming of the show moved from Hollywood to Studio City, Los Angeles. One episode, \"The Bet\", remained unfilmed, as it was considered too provocative by the network, as well as several cast and crew members. Two new writers joined the writing staff, Larry Charles and Peter Mehlman, who would continue to write for the show in later seasons. Even though season two started out with poor ratings, bringing the season to a two-month hiatus, the rest of the season was positively received by critics and was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nA Seasons 1 and 2 DVD box set was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in the United States and Canada on November 23, 2004, 13 years after it completed broadcast on television. In addition to every episode from the two seasons, the DVD release features bonus material, including deleted scenes, inside looks, bloopers, and commentaries.

It comprises 23 episodes and concluded its initial airing on May 6, 1992. \"The Tape\", \"The Pen\", and \"The Letter\" are some of the season's episodes that were inspired by the writers' own experiences. Co-creator Larry David admits that season three was a big turning point for the series in terms of how the show was made; it’s where the writers started doing non linear storylines with episodes containing multiple stories. George was becoming a bigger liar, Elaine was becoming more quirky, and Kramer was becoming surer of himself throughout his crazy antics. This season received eight Emmy nominations and one Directors Guild of America Award.\n\nThe DVD boxset for season three was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in Region 1 on November 23, 2004, twelve years after it had completed broadcast on television. It was also released in Region 2 on November 1, 2004 and on October 18, 2004 in Region 4. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, exclusive stand-up material, and commentaries.",

Because of the \"bump into\" Jerry tells Elaine that she is destined to backslide into her relationship with David Puddy, she bets him $50 that she won't. The next day Jerry discovers that Elaine didn't go home last night, he accuses her of seeing Puddy. She says the sex they had was an isolated incident. Jerry agrees but the dinner they also had was more of a commitment, he demands that she pay up. Kramer is tired of seeing all his ideas implemented, because all the little day to day incidental things keeps getting in his way and keeping him realizing his ideas. He gets an intern from NYU to help him out with Kramerica Industries; the corporation he had previously setup to develop some of his ideas. With this help he'll be freed from the day-to-day activities and be able to develop his ideas, such as the oil tanker bladder. Meanwhile, George is fighting the siege mentality that he is encountering at work and Elaine just can't get Puddy off her mind. No matter what the obstacle, George endeavors to occupy his office. Jerry tells Claire about the voice and she leaves him. The university takes Kramer's intern away from him. Claire says they can get back together if he won't do the voice ever again, he decides the voice is worth it. Unfortunately, everyone is tired off the voice. Elaine pays ups and they decided on a double or nothing bet. The intern comes back on his own because he believes in Kramerica. Play Now tries to negotiate with George, but he won't give in. Later, he offers his office and one of their rubber balls to allow Kramer to test his oil bladder idea. Jerry continues to cash in on his bet with Elaine, who just can't seem to keep away from Puddy. The big test takes place at George's workplace where Jerry plans to meet Claire. They try to warn her about the falling object, but all she hears is the voice. The lawsuit that is filed by Claire puts Play Now out of business and George out of his contract.",

Kramer announces his retirement, a Hollywood big shot has optioned his coffee table book about coffee tables. Elaine finds evidence that leads her to believe her boyfriend is black. Susan's parents see George on the street in the city, during the time he is supposed to be in the Hamptons. Jerry is woken up early in the morning at his parent's house and gives his father the \"$50\" organizer that has many features besides a tip calculator.

Of course, George just builds on the lie. Morty, who can't run for president of the condo association, decides that Kramer should run for condo board president of Del Boca Vista phase III. Once Kramer is elected, Morty will run things from behind the scenes. Elaine schemes to try to determine her boyfriend's race. George finds out the Rosses knew that he lied.

When Elaine's boyfriend says they are an interracial couple, she is convinced he is black. George keeps building on his lie, as he picks up the Rosses and takes them on their ride to the Hamptons. Kramer receives some bad press from the Boca Breeze; it's damage control time. Kramer suggests buying each member of the board one of those Wizard tip calculators. Jerry knows he can't get the deal he told his father he'd received, but Kramer says not to worry, Bob Saccamando's father lives down here and can help them out. Elaine and her boyfriend discover that each is not the race they thought the other was. Saccamando's father comes through with knock-off tip calculators called Willard, they are defective and the election is lost. George and the Rosses reach the Hamptons, where the truth wins out.",

George works to find a solution to his Frogger problem and Kramer volunteers the help of a man he knows named \"Slippery Pete.\" Elaine misses the 4 o'clock sugar rush she had gotten used to from all the celebrations, so she decides to raid Peterman's refrigerator, where she finds a piece of cake.

Lou Solverson, a young State Police Officer recently back from Vietnam, investigates a case involving a local crime gang, a major mob syndicate and small town beautician Peggy Blumquist along with her husband Ed, the local butcher’s assistant.

The investigation will lead them to a colorful cast of characters that includes Karl Weathers, the town lawyer of Luverne, Minnesota; Joe Bulo, the front man for the northern expansion of a Kansas City crime syndicate with his number two, Mike Milligan; and the Gerhardt crime family currently led by matriarch Floyd Gerhardt.",

However, returning after a month, it is revealed she had been talking to Silver's older brother, Gold Steiner, who is not an alchemist but rather a hand-to-hand combat specialist.

However Rimmer will not help Lister and the others escape until he is promoted. Lister secretly takes some of the Luck Virus and escapes from the holding cell and heads to find his compadres.  Kryten is classified as a woman as he has no apparent genitalia and is put in with Kochanski. This won't last long as the engineers are planning to restore him to his factory settings. One thing he cannot do is say no to a superior officer and this event ultimately happens.  Lister finds Kochanski and the Cat (who is being held in the medical bay while they try to figure out exactly what he is) and the three find the no-personality Kryten. To avoid detection they dress up as the Dibbley family using mop heads as wigs and big, ugly false teeth.",

The plots centre around tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty, his bossy wife Sybil, a comparatively normal chambermaid Polly, and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel and their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.\n\nIn a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.",

With a small chance of saving Kurisu, Rintaro agrees to go with Suzuha to just before Kurisu's death. As Rintaro waits in the place where Kurisu's stabbing takes place, he sees Kurisu's father, the Professor Nakamachi he saw that day, attack Kurisu as he tries to steal her time travel theory. As Rintaro attempts to save Kurisu, he inadvertently stabs her himself, allowing Nakamachi to escape with her theory and bring it to Russia. Returning to the present, Rintaro falls into despair but Mayuri knocks some sense into him. Afterwards, Rintaro receives a video mail from his future self, telling him that the key to saving Kurisu without changing the events that led him to create a time machine is to fool his other self into believing Kurisu had died.",

As he prepares to fake Kurisu's death, Rintaro finds the liquid in the sabre had dried up. To this end, he allows himself to be stabbed by Nakabachi, before knocking out Kurisu with a taser and using his own blood to set the scene up for his past self. As Rintaro returns to the past, Suzuha gives her thanks before time is altered so that the time machine was never invented. In this new timeline, Rintaro goes around giving badges to his past lab members, eventually managing to meet Kurisu once again; she was looking for Rintaro to thank him for saving her life, suggesting that the event of their romance doesn't disappear, either.",

The Office is an American adaptation of the British TV series of the same name, and is presented in a mockumentary format, portraying the daily lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.\n\nThis season introduced the main characters, and established the general plot, which revolves around Michael Scott, regional manager of the Scranton branch office, trying to convince the filmmakers of the documentary that he presides over a happy, well-running office. Meanwhile, sales rep Jim Halpert finds methods to undermine his cube-mate, Dwight Schrute; receptionist Pam Beesly tries to deal with Michael's insensitivities and flubs; and temporary employee Ryan Howard is acting mostly as an observer of the insanity around him.\n\nSeason one of The Office aired on Tuesdays in the United States at 9:30 p.m. The season debuted to high numbers, and garnered moderately positive reviews from critics aside from a poorly-received pilot episode. While some enjoyed the pilot, others opined that it was a mere copy of the original British version. Universal Studios Home Entertainment released season one in a single DVD on August 16, 2005. The DVD contained all six episodes, as well as commentaries from creators, writers, actors, and directors on most of the episodes, as well as deleted scenes from all of the episodes.",

The Office is an American adaptation of the British TV series of the same name, and is presented in a mockumentary format, documenting the daily lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.\n\nBeginning with \"The Dundies\", the second season further developed into the plot of the fear of company downsizing, along with the introduction of new characters and developing some of the minor ones—especially that of Dwight Schrute. Michael Scott soon starts a relationship with his boss Jan Levenson and, Pam Beesley and Jim Halpert’s relationship become one of the focal points of the season. Their compatibility becomes more obvious as Jim’s feelings for Pam continue to grow, while she struggles with her relationship with the warehouse worker Roy Anderson.\n\nSeason two of The Office aired on Tuesdays in the United States at 9:30 p.m. from September 20, 2005 to December 6, 2005. The timeslot changed to Thursdays at 9:30 p.m. from January 5, 2006 to May 11, 2006. The season was a ratings success, bolstered by Carell's success in the 2005 film The 40 Year Old Virgin. The season also received glowing reviews from critics, with many calling it one of the greatest sitcom seasons ever produced. The second season was released in a four-disc DVD boxset in Region 1 on September 12, 2006, and in Region 2 on January 28, 2008. The DVD set contained all 22 episodes, as well as commentaries from creators, writers, actors, and directors on some of the episodes, while also containing deleted scenes from all of the episodes.

        "description": "The third season of the American television comedy The Office premiered in the United States on NBC on September 21, 2006, and concluded on May 17, 2007. The season had a total of 25 half-hours of material, divided into 17 half-hour episodes, four 40-minute \"super-sized\" episodes, and two one-hour episodes. The Office is an American adaptation of the British TV series of the same name as a mockumentary portraying the daily lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.\n\nThe season marked the move of main character Jim Halpert from Scranton to Stamford, and also introduced Rashida Jones as Karen Filippelli, and Ed Helms as Andy Bernard—both members of Dunder Mifflin Stamford—as recurring characters. Helms would later be promoted to series regular. The main plot for the early episodes of the season deals with a recurring problem in seasons one and two—the problem of company downsizing—while in the last half of the season, inter-office relationships also became a major plot point.\n\nThe third season of The Office aired on Thursdays at 8:30 p.m.. The season saw its ratings increase from the previous. In addition, it continued the critical praise that had started during the show's second season. The season was released on DVD in a box set containing four discs. While the DVD features all 25 episodes, the episodes \"Traveling Salesmen\" and \"The Return\" were condensed into one episode. The set contained commentaries from creators, writers, actors, and directors on some of the episodes, while also containing deleted scenes from all of the episodes. It was released by Universal Studios Home Entertainment.",

The season consisted of 9 half-hour episodes, and 5 hour-long episodes to comprise the 19 total episodes of material created. The Office is an American adaptation of the British TV series of the same name, and is presented in a mockumentary format, portraying the daily lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The season was interrupted and shortened due to the effects of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, in which the writers and some actors of The Office went on strike; although 30 half-hour episodes had been ordered, only 19 were actually filmed. Several of the finished episodes were condensed into hour-long episodes, resulting in only 14 episodes being aired.\n\nSeason four marked the departure of Karen Filippelli as a regular character, although she appeared for a few seconds in the first episode, \"Fun Run\" and in the sixth episode, \"Branch Wars\", as the regional manager of the Utica branch. Relationships again emerged as the main theme of the season, with Jim Halpert and Pam Beesley's rising, and Michael Scott and Jan Levinson's, as well as Dwight Schrute and Angela Martin's declining. Technology was another prevalent theme as the office staff struggled with initiatives introduced by Ryan Howard to modernize the company.",

The season consisted of 22 half-hour episodes, and 2 hour-long episodes to comprise the 26 total episodes of material created. The Office is an American adaptation of the British TV series of the same name, and is presented in a mockumentary format, portraying the daily lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.\n\nThe season has been cited by several critics as the beginning of the series' decline in quality, despite still receiving generally favorable reviews. The season ranked fifty-second in the season ratings with an average of 7.80 million viewers per episode, marking a steep drop in the ratings from the previous season which had an average of nine million viewers.\n\nThe sixth season of The Office aired on Thursdays at 9:00 p.m. in the United States. The season was released on DVD by Universal Studios Home Entertainment in a four-disc box set in the Region 1 area on September 7, 2010. The DVD set contains all 26 episodes, as well as commentaries from creators, writers, actors, and directors on some of the episodes.

The series is an American adaptation of the British comedy series of the same name, and is presented in a mockumentary format, portraying the daily lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The eighth season of The Office aired on Thursdays at 9:00 p.m. in the United States as part of the \"Comedy Night Done Right\" television block. This was the first season without Steve Carell as Michael Scott in the lead role and the only one to not feature the character in any capacity.\n\nThe eighth season largely centers around Andy Bernard's ascension to regional manager, as well as the antics of Robert California, the new CEO of Sabre, a fictional printer company that owns Dunder Mifflin. Halfway through the season, Dwight Schrute —along with Jim Halpert, Stanley Hudson, Ryan Howard, Erin Hannon, and Cathy —travel to Florida to help set up a Sabre Store, where Nellie Bertram is introduced. Eventually, former CEO of Dunder Mifflin David Wallace buys back the company, firing California.",
